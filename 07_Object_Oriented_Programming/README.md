# Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This folder introduces OOP concepts in Python, including:

## Topics Covered
- **Classes and Objects**: Creating and using classes.
- **Inheritance**: Reusing code with inheritance.
- **Polymorphism**: Writing flexible and reusable code.

## Best Practices
1. Use meaningful names for classes and methods.
2. Keep classes focused on a single responsibility.
3. Use inheritance judiciously to avoid complexity.

### Fun Fact
Python supports multiple inheritance, allowing a class to inherit from more than one parent class!
