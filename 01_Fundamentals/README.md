# Python Fundamentals

Welcome to the Fundamentals of Python! This folder contains the basics of Python programming, including:

## Topics Covered
- **Hello World**: Your first Python program.
- **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding variables and their types.
- **Input and Output**: Taking input and displaying output.
- **Basic Operators**: Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.

## Variable Rules
1. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_).
2. Variable names cannot start with a number.
3. Variable names can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _).
4. Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., `myVar` and `myvar` are different).

### Fun Fact
Python was named after the British comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus," not the snake!
